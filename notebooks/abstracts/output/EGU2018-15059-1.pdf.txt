ESA Swarm satellites carry a magnetometry payload consisting of an absolute scalar magnetometer (ASM), a
relative ﬂux gate vector magnetometer (VFM), and a set of star trackers (STR). The primary role of the ASM
is to provide precise 1 Hz absolute ﬁeld intensity measurements, while the VFM and STR provide the additional
data needed to accurately reconstruct the vector ﬁeld. This magnetometry payload has provided a remarkable set of
vector data, which has extensively been used for multiple investigations, as illustrated by the many results presented
in this session. Each ASM instrument, however, can also produce its own self-calibrated 1 Hz experimental vector
data, and if requested, 250 Hz scalar burst mode. Self-calibrated 1 Hz experimental vector data have routinely
been produced ever since launch, except for short periods of time during commissioning, when burst mode data
were produced. In this talk, we will give an overview of the type of science that can be achieved with both these
datasets, illustrate the added value they bring to the Swarm mission, and brieﬂy discuss the possibility they revealed
for designing a nanosatellite mission that could be launched in the near-future for complementing and enhancing
the science return of the now extended Swarm mission.
