Wave breaking transfers momentum between waves to currents. In doing so it dissipates wave energy and
affects long-term dispersion and transport of tracers, Wave breaking also affects the transfer of wind stresses to
the ocean and is a major player in ocean acoustics, the dynamics of near-surface gas exchanges and the dynamics
of phytoplankton and buoyant pollutants.

Progressive waves were generated numerically using a numerical Navier Stokes solver. The velocity ﬁeld
was then used to estimate Lagrangian parcel dynamics in the neighborhood of the breaking event. The transport
generated by the breaking events is shown to be signiﬁcant, when compared to the wave-generated residual ﬂow,
as captured by the Stokes drift.
We formulate a parametrization of the breaking velocity based upon an analysis of the Largrangian dynamics of
ﬂuid parcels. Further, we describe how the breaking velocity is incorporated in the {\it vortex force} formulation
of wave current interactions.
