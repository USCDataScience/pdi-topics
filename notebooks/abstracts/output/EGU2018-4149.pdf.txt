China has committed to peak emission at 2030 and other carbon emissions reduction targets in the Paris climate
agreement. After experimenting with carbon trading in seven cities, China is starting a carbon trading system across
the nation. Major efforts have been ongoing and are expected to intensify in emissions reduction both for climate
change mitigation and improving air quality. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei City Cluster has arguably the highest car-
bon emission intensity in the world. It is urgently needed to monitor and analyze the dynamics of emissions at
sufﬁciently high resolution and accuracy in support of carbon trading and other low-carbon development efforts
at national, regional, city, community and individual scales.Our objectives are: 1) To establish a carbon moni-
toring system for the JJJ region with continuous observations of CO2 from space, air, and ground;2) To create
an inventory-based high resolution estimates of carbon emissions;3) To produce best estimates of carbon sources
and sinks using model-data assimilation approach;4) To apply the data and knowledge to low-carbon development
goals of government, industry, and communities.
