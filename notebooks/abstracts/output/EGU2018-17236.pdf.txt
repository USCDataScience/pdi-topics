Over the course of the last couple of years, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by
ECMWF on behalf of the European Union, developed a number of applications operating on a seasonal time
scale. These prototype services -which are currently becoming operational- address the needs of a variety of users
in different sectors using the freely available C3S seasonal prediction data. Starting from a set of concrete service
examples for the water, the agricultural and the energy sector we here present the general C3S strategy for devel-
oping applications of seasonal prediction using the C3S infrastructure. A particular emphasis is put on describing
what is currently available in the Climate Data Store, what will become available in the near future and what
additional opportunities will be for the research community.
