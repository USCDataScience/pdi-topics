Scientiﬁc Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites monitor parameters that are relevant for space weather quantiﬁ-
cation and modelling. The missions provide global coverage and, thanks to their duration of several years, they
also provide excellent opportunities for developing global empirical and physical models of the ionosphere and
thermosphere.
This presentation includes perspectives from the H2020 project SWAMI (Space Weather Atmosphere Model and
Indices) that started in January 2018. Within this activity, the CIRA thermosphere speciﬁcation model DTM2013
will be improved by assimilating more neutral density data to reduce remaining biases due to incomplete modelling
of solar activity and seasonal variations. These new data includes ﬁve more years of GRACE high-resolution
observations from 2012-2016, the last year of the GOCE mission, Swarm mean density data, and mean neutral
densities from 2010-2017 inferred from geodetic satellites at about 800 km.
In the early phase of the project, the DTM2013 model will be compared with these new density data to identify
systematic errors. The model performance under geomagnetic storm conditions will be analysed and used as a
benchmark for comparison with new models that are parameterized with a higher cadence (< 3 h) Kp index and
empirical Kp predictions.
Within the SWAMI activity, the upper boundary of the Met Ofﬁce Uniﬁed Model (UM) shall be extended from
around 85 km to around 150-170 km. A key building block of this extended UM is the development of new
radiation schemes in the ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. The DTM will then be coupled
to the UM at around the 120-160 km altitude region in order to create a whole atmosphere model. The resulting
model can be used for launch operations, re-entry computations, orbit prediction, and aeronomy and space weather
studies.
