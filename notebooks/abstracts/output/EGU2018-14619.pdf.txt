Satellite remote sensing of sulfur dioxide is widely used to monitor volcanic degassing globally, in particular since
2004 with measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). In this study, we present the ﬁrst SO2
results from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) which was launched onboard the Sentinel-5
Precursor (S5P) platform on October 2017. While OMI and TROPOMI have similar spectral performances, the
TROPOMI instrument has a spatial resolution of 7x3.5 km2, which is a factor of 12 better than OMI (13x24
km2, before the OMI instrument gets affected by the so-called row anomaly issue). For a selection of degassing
volcanoes, we illustrate the improved capability of TROPOMI to monitor volcanic SO2 emissions compared to
OMI. In particular, we discuss the ability of the new sensor to detect smaller volcanic sources with better accuracy
and selectivity. The retrieval challenges associated with higher resolution measurements are addressed, as well as
new opportunities provided by TROPOMI to estimate volcanic SO2 ﬂuxes, with a detection limit of about a factor
of 3 better than OMI. Plans for future work including validation are presented.
