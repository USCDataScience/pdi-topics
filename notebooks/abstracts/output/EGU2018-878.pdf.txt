Clouds are vital for the Earth’s shortwave, longwave radiation and energy budgets, and thus for global climate.
However, despite the great progress in their observation during the last two decades, there is still considerable
uncertainty even about their basic properties such as their fractional cloud cover (CC). More speciﬁcally, uncer-
tainties related to their long-term changes hinder their inclusion in assessments of ongoing and future climate
changes. To this aim, continued efforts to improve capabilities of observing CC and its inter-annual variability and
trends are necessary, with remote sensing playing a key role and assisting in creating relevant long-term uniform
global databases.
The Cloud Albedo Radiation, AVHRR-based, edition 2 (CLARA-A2) data record has been created using measure-
ments of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument onboard the polar orbiting NOAA
and the EUMETSAT METOP satellites. In the present study the global distribution, variability and trends of CC
over the period 1982 – 2015 are analyzed using monthly averages of CLARA-A2 data on a spatial resolution of
2.5◦ × 2.5◦ latitude-longitude. Furthermore, a comparison of CLARA-A2 is attempted against the International
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP-D2) over their common period 1984-2009. CLARA-A2 has the ad-
vantage of enabling a longer temporal coverage (34 against 26 years) while ensuring complete spatial coverage,
also including the polar areas which are often missing in ISCCP-D2.
The analysis for the common 26-year common period shows that both CLARA-A2 and ISCCP-D2 reproduce
well-known global CC patterns, such as the increased values of high-level CC (up to 80 %) along the Intertropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the extended low-level cloud decks off the western coasts of South America and
southern Africa (coverage up to 60 %). The computed 26-year global mean total CC is equal to 62.3 and 65.6
% according to CLARA-A2 and ISCCP-D2, respectively. The corresponding global mean values of CLARA-A2
low-, mid- and high-level cloud cover are equal to 19.8, 17.4 and 24.1 %, respectively, while those for ISCCP-
D2 are 22.9, 20.1 and 22.6 %, i.e. CLARA-A2 underestimates low and middle and overestimates high-level CC
with respect to ISCCP-D2. The 34-year time series of CLARA-A2 global mean total CC reveal an overall linear
decrease equal to -2 %, arising from a stronger decrease of mid-level CC (-2.9 %) and weak increases of low-
and high-level CC (0.4 and 0.3 %, respectively). A more detailed analysis indicates decadal-scale increases and
decreases of total CC, consisting in slight modiﬁcations up to mid-90s, a subsequent prolonged decrease through to
the end of 2000s and a following increase in the 2010s. Such long-term changes of cloud cover are very important
in the context of ongoing climate change, but need to be further assessed and evaluated given the inhomogeneity
issues in their time series. In this context, a comparison of CLARA-A2 with the latest release of ISCCP -H series
will be made, while CLARA-A2 CC data shall be used in a detailed radiative transfer model in order to estimate
the 34-year global cloud radiative effects and the associated radiation budget.
