The Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information Systematic Services
(IG3IS) Implementation Plan

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in partnership with UN Environment (UNEP) and other partners
has initiated the development of an Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System (IG3IS). IG3IS will
work closely with the inventory builders and other stakeholders who need to track GHG emissions to develop
methodologies for how atmospheric GHG concentration measurements (the top-down) can be combined with
spatially and temporally explicit emission inventory data (the bottom-up) to better inform and manage emission
reduction policies and measures. IG3IS will focus on existing-use cases for which the scientiﬁc and technical skill
is proven and on where IG3IS information can meet the expressed (or previously unrecognized) needs of decision
makers who will value the information. The ultimate success criteria are that the IG3IS information is “used”
and guides valuable and additional emission reduction actions, building conﬁdence in the role of atmospheric
composition measurements as an essential part of the climate change mitigation tool kit.

This presentation will focus on IG3IS implementation, which is now underway.The IG3IS team deﬁned
four implementation objectives, the ﬁrst three being: 1) support for reducing uncertainties in national emission
inventory reporting to UNFCCC; 2) locate and quantify previously unknown emission reduction opportunities
such as fugitive methane emissions from industrial sources; 3) provide subnational entities such as large urban
source regions (megacities) with timely and quantiﬁed information on the amounts, trends and attribution by
sector of their GHG emissions to evaluate and guide progress towards emission reduction goals, and 4) support
for the Paris Agreement Global Stock Take activities.
