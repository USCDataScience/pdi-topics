Overview of the StratoClim Asian Monsoon Aircraft Campaign:
Measurements and First Results

The StratoClim aircraft ﬁeld campaign employing the high-ﬂying research aircraft M55 Geophysica was carried
out from mid July to mid August of 2017 from Kathmandu, Nepal, in the frame of the EC FP7 funded StratoClim
project. As a result we obtained the ﬁrst detailed data set on climate relevant dynamical, chemical, and micro-
chemical processes within the Asian Summer Monsoon anticyclone employing a comprehensive chemical and
aerosol payload consisting of 26 different instruments on a total of 8 science ﬂights and exploring the 12-20km
altitude regime above Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. While mostly ﬂying inside the anticyclone area we probed
the ATAL layer, the cold tropopause region, and the lower stratosphere in or above regions of convective activity
as well as of potential Himalayan updraft.
An overview of the instrumentation, observation strategies, and ﬁrst results will be presented.
