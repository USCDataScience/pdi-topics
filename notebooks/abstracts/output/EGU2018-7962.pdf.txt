During the last years, a seamless probabilistic forecasting system (SAPHIR) has been continuously developed at
ZAMG. The system is designed to provide the best possible deterministic weather information as well as proba-
bilistic forecasts on very high resolution (1km). The system is updated up to every 10 minutes and spans the forecast
horizons from the current state of the atmosphere, minutes to hours ahead, up to the short range of +72 hours. The
system integrates various kinds of observation data (i.e. station data, radar and satellite data) and smartly combines
observation-based analysis and nowcasting methods, ensemble nowcasting, a convection-permitting RUC model,
a convection-permitting EPS, ensemble calibration, and regional and global deterministic and probabilistic NWP
models.
The concept of the system and ﬁrst results will be presented and discussed.
