The goal of the ESA ITT project AO-1-8384-15-1-NB VSWMC-Part 2 is to further develop the Virtual Space
Weather Modelling Centre (VSWMC), building on the Phase 1 prototype system and focusing on the interaction
with the ESA SSA SWE system. The objective and scopes of this project include:
1. The efﬁcient integration of new models and new model couplings, including a ﬁrst demonstration of an
end-to-end simulation capability.
2. The further development and wider use of the coupling toolkit and the front-end GUI which will be designed to
be accessible via the SWE Portal.
3. Availability of more accessible input and output data on the system and development of integrated visualization
tool modules.

The consortium that took up this challenge involves: 1) the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Prime Con-
tractor, coordinator: Prof. S. Poedts); 2) the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA-IASB); 3) the Royal
Observatory of Belgium (ROB); 4) the Von Karman Institute (VKI); 5) DH Consultancy (DHC); 6) Space
Applications Services (SAS); 7) British Antarctic Survey (BAS).

The VSWMC-Part 2 project started on 17 February 2016. At the time of the EGU 2018 meeting, Part 2B
will be almost ﬁnished, which means that all models (EUHFORIA, CTIM, CTAN2, BAS-RBM, COOLFluiD,
GUMICS, etc.) and model couplings will be installed and operational in the VSWMC. Hence, it will be demon-
strated.

The VSWMC system is being developed under ESA’s Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Programme and
is intended to become an operational system as part of the ESA SSA SWE system.
