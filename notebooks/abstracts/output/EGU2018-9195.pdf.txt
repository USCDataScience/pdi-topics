Sea-state dependency of air-sea ﬂuxes in ECMWF Earth System Model

The global analyses and medium range forecasts from the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasts
rely on a state of the art atmospheric model. In order to best represent the momentum exchange at the surface
of the oceans, it is tightly coupled to an ocean wave model. An ocean model is now included as part of the
operational medium range forecasting system. In this context, a ﬁrst set of sea state effects on Upper Ocean
mixing and dynamics was successfully added to the system. Impact of sea-state dependent momentum forcing,
the Stokes-Coriolis force and the enhanced mixing by breaking ocean waves have been added.
Because the feedback from the ocean can be signiﬁcant, it is only in the fully coupled system that parameterisation
for air-sea processes should be revisited. For instance, experimental evidences point to a sea state/wind dependency
of the heat and moisture ﬂuxes. Following an extension of the wind wave generation theory, a sea state dependent
parameterisation for the roughness length scales for heat and humidity was introduced. Assessment of the different
parameterisations will be presented in the context of the fully coupled system.
