Mapping of intertidal sediment using in-situ sampling is time-consuming and has health and safety complications,
especially for higher tidal range regions. Remote sensing is attractive to overcome these difﬁculties. Previous
investigators utilised hyperspectral sensors on aircraft and satellites to map intertidal sediment type; however, cost
and spatial resolution mean additional tools are desirable. One option is the exploitation of UAVs carrying a range
of sensors.
In this study a small ﬁxed wing UAV is ﬂown with RGB cameras, thermal cameras and multispectral cameras at
various locations in a mega-tidal environment (Swansea Bay, UK). Sediment is characterised over the ﬂight areas
by in-situ surface moisture content measurements, temperature and grain size distribution. This presentation will
describe the variation of remotely sensed parameters over the intertidal region and their relation to sediment type
and moisture content. Discussion of the potential to utilise this variation to identify different sediment types will
be made.
