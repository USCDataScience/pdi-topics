The formation of turbulence in magnetic reconnection outﬂows of space plasmas has been recently ascertained
by spacecraft observation, showing a good comparison with numerical simulations. In this work we study the
turbulence that develops through the collision between two counter-propagating reconnection outﬂows each one
coming form a different reconnection site in the presence of a strong guide ﬁeld. We show the results of a 3D
particle in cell (PIC) simulation with kinetic ion and electrons, spacial resolution equal to the electron inertial
length and not realistic mass-ratio (mi/me =256).
When the two jets approach each other a secondary current sheet forms between the two causing a secondary
reconnection event. After this phase several new current sheets forms in the outﬂows giving rise to a turbulent
regime. We study the properties of this turbulence by means of spectral analysis. We present as well a method by
which the turbulent region can be singled out from the whole simulation domain and studied separately from the
non turbulent one.
