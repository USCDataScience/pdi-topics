Gravity waves (GW) are an essential part of the dynamics of Earth’s atmosphere. They transport energy and
momentum from the lower to the middle atmosphere. The distribution of gravity wave energy is important for
understanding the global circulation. The effects of GW are often described by parametrization schemes in global
circulation models.
In the ARISE 2 project lidar measurements are performed at different sites covering low, middle and high latitudes.
This allows to deduce gravity wave energies at different latitudes and orographic situations. By this we can extend
and improve global maps of GW energy distribution that are also available from satellite observations. Compared
to satellite data the lidar observations have a high temporal and vertical resolution which is beneﬁcial for under-
standing the evolution of GW events.
Using lidar observations we study GW on vertical and temporal scales of a few hundred meters and a few minutes.
We perform an inter-comparison of lidar measurements and the methods used to derive gravity wave parameters.
We present results obtained for the short-term variability of temperature proﬁles measured by lidars located at
middle to high latitudes.
