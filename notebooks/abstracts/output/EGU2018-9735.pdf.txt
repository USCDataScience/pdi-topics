Slipping and Sliding: Capturing the Earth in Motion by Scientiﬁc Ocean
Drilling

Since the beginning of ocean drilling, sampling and dating reﬂection-seismically imaged tectono-stratigraphic
sections and recovering sediments and rocks from marine convergent plate-boundary systems has advanced our
understanding of subduction zone structures and evolution. It further evidenced the dynamic nature of deformation,
ﬂuid ﬂow and mass ﬂuxes within such systems. With the advancement in developing borehole observatories,
monitoring data is increasingly becoming available to analyze and quantify the dynamic processes, such as those
leading to and resulting from earthquakes, slides and tsunamis. Short instrumental records, however, limit our
perspective of maximum magnitude and recurrence of such submarine geohazard processes. Examining past
events expressed as sedimentary or geochemical perturbations preserved in the marine record provides IODP the
key to address this challenge on relevant time scales.

This talk summarizes recent efforts by IODP and related method-developments to unravel the marine-geological
record for advancing our understanding on past earthquake occurrences and resulting dynamic responses of deep-
water seaﬂoor and sub-seaﬂoor environments. In particular, I highlight the role of earthquakes on event-triggered
sediment mass transfer and carbon cycling in deep sea trenches, such as those around the Paciﬁc rim of ﬁre and
representing the deepest parts of our world(cid:48)s ocean.
