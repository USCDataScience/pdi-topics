Reconstructing Solar Magnetic Field Evolution Over the Past Century

Alexei Pevtsov
National Solar Observatory, Boulder, United States (apevtsov@nso.edu)

This talk will review the current state of long- term synoptic programs and present results of several recent projects
aimed at reconstructing a more detailed picture of solar activity over the last century. In particular, we will present
the recent ﬁndings and discuss open questions of research projects by international team 420 supported by the
International Space Science Institute (Bern, Switzerland, see http://www.issibern.ch/teams/solheliomagnet/#). The
team aims at developing methods to study the evolution of magnetic activity prior to modern age of solar magne-
tography using historical data from Kodaikanal (India) and Mount Wilson (USA) observatories and modern surface
ﬂux transport models.
