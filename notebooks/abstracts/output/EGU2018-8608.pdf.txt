Empirical Models of Atmospheric Pressure Fluctuations at the Ground
Surface from 1-day period to 8 Hz

The infrasound component of the International Monitoring System (IMS) is composed of sixty stations, among
which ﬁfty are already certiﬁed and continuously transmit data to the International Data Centre. Each infrasound
station is composed of an array of infrasound measurement systems capable of measuring the pressure ﬂuctuations
produced at ground surface. These pressure ﬂuctuations are produced by a combination of atmospheric phenomena
such as meteorological processes, atmospheric tides, gravity waves, wind turbulence and acoustic sources. The
objective of this presentation is to deﬁne reliable low- and high-noise empirical models for pressure ﬂuctuations
measured at the ground surface from 1-day period to 8 Hz. These models support several IMS applications such as
sensor testing, sensor self-calibration, data quality control and wind-noise reduction system design. While several
models were proposed in the past, they were band-limited and included several limitations such as the use of non-
calibrated or erroneous data or the non-correction of system responses. The progress recently made with system
response modelling and calibration together with the use of advanced signal processing techniques now allow to
propose reliable and extremely large-band models. In addition the obtained results allow characterizing processes
such as gravity wave saturation or ﬂuctuation in the buoyancy frequency. They also allow distinguishing between
the different types of wind turbulence responsible for background pressure ﬂuctuations.
