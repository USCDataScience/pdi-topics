Although ESA’s Earth Explorer Mission Swarm is primarily dedicated to measure the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld,
it currently also serves as a gravity ﬁeld mission. Equipped with GPS receivers, accelerometers, star-tracker
assemblies and laser retro-reﬂectors, the three Swarm satellites provide the necessary instrumentation to be
used as a high-low satellite-to-satellite tracking (hl-SST) observing system. Since GRACE-B, one of the two
satellites of the GRACE mission dedicated to measure the time-variability of the Earth’s gravity ﬁeld, has been
decommissioned on 12 Oct 2017, Swarm is now in the focus to close the gap between the GRACE and its
Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission.

In this presentation we will report the current state of Swarm gravity ﬁeld determination as performed at
various analysis centers. Besides the individual contributions we will also present combined Swarm solutions
computed by the scientiﬁc combination service established in the frame of the European Gravity Service for
Improved Emergency Management (EGSIEM) initiative. Besides this, we will assess the various efforts made to
mitigate systematic errors in the Swarm Level-1B GPS data related to ionospheric activity that are affecting the
Swarm gravity ﬁeld solutions.
