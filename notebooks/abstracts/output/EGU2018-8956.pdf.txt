The association of extreme events in rainfall over India with modes of different scales of variability of the monsoon
is discussed. The extreme events in rainfall over different regions of India have shown an increasing trend during
last several decades. This study examines the relation of the extreme events with synoptic-scale activities, intrasea-
sonal oscillations and interannual variability of the monsoon. The low-pressure systems (LPSs), formed mainly
over the Bay of Bengal, are synoptic-scale systems that bring copious amount of rainfall over India through lows
and depressions. The leading intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs), with 45-day and 30-day periods, propagate from the
Indian Ocean and contribute to the active/break cycle of the rainfall. On interannual time scale, El Niño-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the seasonal mean rainfall. The trends
in the LPSs, ISOs and the interannual variability and their association with the extreme events are presented.
