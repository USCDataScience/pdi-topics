The use of sentinel imagery for analysing weather related risk impacts on
agriculture

Risk management is becoming increasingly important for European farmers. Greater market orientation of the
European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has led to more exposure to market risks. In addition to
increased price volatility, the growing number of unusual weather events makes farming an even riskier business
these days. A full understanding of the risks and means to reduce them can only emerge from crossing the
old-established industry of agriculture with the latest service that big data analysis can offer. Satellite imagery
may further boost this recent data-driven business.

Current data driven models have predominantly concentrated on dealing with impacts on yields at the re-
gional scale, whereas damages are expressed in yield loss at the ﬁeld scale. A lot of data are available on the
input side to include soil and weather, but very few on the output side, namely yield and quality at the ﬁeld scale.
A new era of satellite remote sensing and sensor technology has already offered a paradigm shift towards data
rich environments with unprecedented possibilities to monitor crop status at higher spatial, temporal and spectral
resolutions. Combining crop modelling and statistical analysis with monitoring from remote sensing presents new
business opportunities to deliver risk assessments to the insurance industry supporting farmers that are faced with
ever more increasing unusual weather events.

Examples will be drawn from different risk assessments of common arable crop production stemming from
different Flemish, Belgian and European projects.
