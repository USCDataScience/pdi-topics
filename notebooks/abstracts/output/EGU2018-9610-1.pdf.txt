NOAA’s Strategic Plans for operational environmental modeling

The US National Weather Service (NWS) runs a large number of operational models, generally know as the
Production Suite. Driven by external reviews, a strategic plan and a roadmap for the production suite have been
developed. Planning has been done at four stages.

1. A NOAA-wide Uniﬁed Modeling Committee (UMC) coordinates modeling between the NOAA line of-
ﬁces, including the NWS. The UMC provides strategic guidance to NOAA.

2. A Strategic Vision document has been developed outlining a transition of NOAA environmental model-
ing to a Uniﬁed Community approach. This is a strategic document, approved by the senior leadership of NOAA
Line Ofﬁces.

3. A roadmap document has been developed to outline how the Production Suite of the NWS and its part-
ners can with transition to an approach based on a Uniﬁed Forecast System across scales, including a fully coupled
environmental modeling approach, with full resolution ensembles and reforecasts and reanalyses. This represents
a 5-10 year plan approved by senior leadership of LOs contributing to the Production Suite.

4. A strategic implementation plan has been developed to implement the Roadmap. This is a three-year ex-
ecution plan, that will be updated annually, and is review by the funding authorities within the line ofﬁces.

The presentation will review the main elements of the four plans, as well as the status of the transition of
the Production Suite to its new uniﬁed and simpliﬁed conﬁguration for seamless prediction across local to global
spatial scales with temporal ranges from minutes to seasons.
