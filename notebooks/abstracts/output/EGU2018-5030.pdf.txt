Paleoclimatic insights into forcing and response of monsoon rainfall

Paleoclimatic evidence of monsoon rainfall dynamics across different regions and timescales could help us to
understand and predict the sensitivity and response of monsoons to varying environmental conditions. Monsoon
rainfall records show that large-scale meridional temperature gradients and the related position of the intertropical
convergence zone strongly shape the monsoon dynamics. However, study of past monsoons also reveals that these
temperature gradients are sensitive to many types of forcing, the inﬂuence of which seems to vary in time and space.
For instance, orbital forcing affects all the monsoon domains by changing the meridional gradient in insolation
and, hence, heating. However, there is no consistent response of the speciﬁc monsoon systems to orbitally forced
insolation changes. This is partly due to the internal feedback mechanisms such as ocean–atmosphere interaction.
We discuss some of the main forcings of monsoon variability and their uncertainties, and argue that a coordinated
effort to quantify past variations in meridional temperature gradients and the connection between oceanic heat
transport and monsoon systems will provide a crucial test bed for model improvement.
