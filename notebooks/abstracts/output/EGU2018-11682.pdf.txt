Here we present the ﬁrst outcomes of ETHZ’s Sun2Ice project, which aims to use a state-of-the-art, highly-
optimized, solar-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), AtlantikSolar, for long-range, and multi-day moni-
toring of calving glaciers in the Arctic. The „midnight sun“ in polar summer time offers unique conditions for
solar-powered ﬂights, including potentially energetically perpetual ﬂight, consequently enabling frequent, high-
resolution and large-scale glacier surveys. In Sun2Ice, this cutting-edge technology is dedicated to the monitoring
of iceberg calving, a still poorly understood process which plays a major role in the observed retreat of many
ocean-terminating glaciers. The main achievement of Sun2Ice’s 2017 ﬁeldwork was the undertaking of the ﬁrst-
ever autonomous, solar-powered ﬂights of a UAV in a polar region, including a ﬂight of more than 12 hours
duration, and the survey of the calving front of Bowdoin Glacier, Northwest Greenland. This monitoring revealed
the opening of a major crack, which led to a major calving event one week later. This presentation will focus on
the technical challenges, the glaciological outcomes, and the potential of using such a technology for monitoring
the Cryosphere with a spatial and temporal resolution not achievable by satellite remote sensing.
