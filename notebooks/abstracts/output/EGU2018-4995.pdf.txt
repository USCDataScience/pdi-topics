Ionosphere is the upper layer of the atmosphere and is produced when Sun’s radiation ionizes atoms and molecules
within this layer.
Different natural and artiﬁcial phenomena affect physical behavior of the Earth’s ionosphere. Among these, solar
eclipse is a phenomenon which has an apparent effect on the ionosphere. Solar eclipses occur when Sun, Earth
and Moon are aligned at the phase of new Moon, in which the Moon is placed directly between the Sun and the
Earth and its shadow falls on the Earth.
Remote sensing the ionosphere during the solar eclipse provides great opportunity to study this phenomena and
the behavior of ionospheric parameters through its occurrence.
On each solar eclipse the geometry of eclipse formation, magnetizes plasma differently so none of them make
exact similar disturbances. In this study we investigate the effects of the solar eclipse on ionospheric models
and scintillation indices before, during, and after eclipse incidence at August 21st 2017. Daily observations
from ground-based IGS stations over North-America were used for ionosphere modeling and also high-rate GPS
observations from UNAVCO data center which includes thousands of globally distributed permanent station
network were used for studying scintillation indices.
The driven results of this study demonstrate that scintillation effects are signiﬁcantly reduced when solar eclipse
occurs. Regarding TEC models, our results conﬁrm previous studies on ionospheric responses to eclipse as well
as theoretical assumptions.
