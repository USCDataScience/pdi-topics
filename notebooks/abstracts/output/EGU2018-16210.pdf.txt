The present-day terrestrial atmosphere, as dominated by the volatile elements nitrogen and oxygen, is provid-
ing a habitable environment for a diverse range of life forms. However, simulations of the terrestrial paleo-
magnetosphere as well as of the solar wind induced atmospheric ion-pickup escape ∼4 Gyr ago (see e.g. [1])
are indicating that during the harsh conditions of the Hadean and early Archean eons a nitrogen dominated atmo-
sphere would not have been able to survive, but would have been eroded within a few million years due to the
high EUV ﬂux and the strong solar wind of the early Sun [2][3]. In addition, these results are suggesting that the
present-day nitrogen-dominated atmosphere has its origin during later stages of the geological history of the Earth,
whereas for the late Hadean and early Archean, CO2 can be considered as the dominating atmospheric constituent.
However, the small 14N/15N isotope disequilibrium between internal and surface reservoirs at the Earth [4] is in-
dicating that some atmospheric escape of nitrogen should have taken place in the past. This escape, as well as the
overall historical composition of the atmosphere are strongly coupled to the shape of the paleo-magnetosphere and
to its interplay with the varying solar activity factors.
We will present simulations of the terrestrial paleo-magnetosphere during the late Hadean and Archean eons and
its inﬂuence on the evolution of the terrestrial nitrogen atmosphere. This also includes an estimation of nitrogen
lost to space based on the observed terrestrial 14N/15N fractionation. Our results support the idea that the nitro-
gen dominated atmosphere started to build up during the Archean eon and slowly evolved from a low-pressure
atmosphere via outgassing of N2 into the present-day habitable environment. Important environmental conditions
for this evolution and its interconnections will be discussed within this presentation. This also includes a potential
solution for the before mentioned 14N/15N disequilibrium.
