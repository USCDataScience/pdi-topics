Numerous observations demonstrate that river discharge can change during seismic ground shaking caused by
earthquakes. Many studies have used stream-gauge data to report distinct co-seismic peaks or drops in river ﬂow,
although little guidance is available to how objectively identify these changes in time series. To this end, we
review the available R packages for detecting change points in time series. We offer an alternative by adapting an
analytical Bayesian approach for ﬁnding a single change point in raw daily discharge time series from some 250
Chilean gauging stations covering the timing of several historic megathrust earthquakes. We show that our approach
produces high (>0.95) posterior probabilities of credible discharge changes coinciding with the earthquake dates,
and exclusively at stations close to the rupture zone. We also show that this spatial pattern of credible river response
is consistent with empirical observations and theoretical considerations, and capable of masking out local effects
of storm runoff. We discuss the constraints of our approach in terms of ﬁnding an optimal search interval or pre-
processing the input data; compare it to other, more sophisticated techniques; and highlight the scope of simple
and reproducible change-point detection methods for other common tasks in the geosciences.
