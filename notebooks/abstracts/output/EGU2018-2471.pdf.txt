With exascale computing becoming available in the next decade, global weather prediction at the kilometer
scale will be enabled. Moreover, the climate community has already begun to contemplate a new generation of
high-resolution climate models.

High-resolution model development is confronted with several challenges. Scalability of the models needs
to be optimal, including all relevant components such as I/O which easily becomes a bottleneck; both runtime
and I/O will dictate how ﬁne a resolution can be chosen while still being able to run the model at production
level, e.g. at 1-30 years/day depending on the questions to be addressed. Moreover, given various scalability
experiments from prototypical runs and additional model data, estimating performance for new simulations can
become challenging. Finally, the actual forecast quality of the models at that scale is not fully understood yet.

I present results achieved in the scope of the Centre of Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate
in Europe (ESiWACE) using the ICON model for global high-resolution simulations. I show results from
multi-week global 5km simulations, I discuss current features and limits of the simulations, and I link the ﬁndings
to a new intercomparison initiative DYAMOND for high-resolution predictions. Finally, I ﬁnish with work on
performance prediction approaches for existing performance data.
