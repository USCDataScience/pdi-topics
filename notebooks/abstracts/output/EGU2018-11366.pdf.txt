Ion acceleration at collisionless shocks

Recent results of large 2D and 3D hybrid (kinetic ions-ﬂuid electrons) ﬁrst-principles simulations of ion accelera-
tion at non-relativistic collisionless shocks are presented.
Proton acceleration, magnetic ﬁeld generation, and injection and acceleration of ions with arbitrary mass-to-charge
ratios are characterized in detail as a function of the shock parameters, such as inclination and Mach number.
Results are used to test and complement the classical theory of diffusive shock acceleration.
Moreover, with the same ab-initio techniques, I investigate the re-acceleration of pre-energized “seed” particles
and discuss the relevant plasma instabilities driven by energetic ions, which lead to a signiﬁcant rearrangement
and ampliﬁcation of the background magnetic ﬁeld.
