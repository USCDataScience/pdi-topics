After more than 4 years in orbit, the Swarm constellation mission has collected global measurements of the ge-
omagnetic ﬁeld as well as the ionospheric plasma environment with a reasonable coverage in season and local
time. The Swarm mission started around the maximum of the solar cycle 24 and has collected data during its
declining phase. These data, sometimes combined with data from earlier or contemporary LEO satellites, have
enabled climatological studies of ionospheric currents and plasma structures. For examples, the longitudinal vari-
ability of atmospheric wave structures in the equatorial electrojet and the seasonal dependence of the Poynting ﬂux
associated with low latitude plasma depletions have been studied. Furthermore, evidence was found for a plasma
depletion threshold at which severe disturbances of navigational signals occur. In this review, we will present a
number of novel studies and discuss open questions that have been raised from these observations.
