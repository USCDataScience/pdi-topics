Index-based insurance is a very efﬁcient strategy for protecting farmers(cid:48) incomes, when a climatic catastrophic
event occurs. The extreme climatic events that affect farmers more frequently are drought and ﬂoods, which in
turn are associated with large economic. Index-based insurance does not need in situ veriﬁcation of the insured
event, with the occurrence being determined by an index that is much correlated with the farmer(cid:48)s losses.

For this study, we rely in previous studies, which helped determine agro-ecological homogenous zones
(AHZ) with similar climatic and soil conditions through principal components analysis. In the rice crop study
area, in Babahoyo canton-Ecuador, two main AHZ were delimited, named f7 and f15. The differences among
these two AHZs, both over bare soil and over rice crop, were statistically signiﬁcant using soil reﬂectance and
NDVI respectively. The most important soil differences between zones f7 and f15 are slope, texture, and effective
depth; and related with climate is precipitation.

In this stage of the study, seventeen years of NDVI data (2001-2017) along rainfed rice crop cycle in
Ecuador (January to May) were analysed using MODIS imagery. It permitted sampling rice yield in zones f7 and
f15 during rice crop cycle of 2016 and 2017. Then, these yields were correlated with its corresponding NDVI
values, obtaining a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.84. The correlation coefﬁcient between the estimated yields with
found yields was also acceptable (0.8). Therefore, we have chosen NDVI as an index for indicating the occurrence
of drought and ﬂooding, due to the high sensibility of this index to these events, evidenced in the temporal data
analysis and for its high correlation with yield.
The threshold value of NDVI average of rice crop cycle was 0.4, which was established through the mean of
the years that were deeply affected by drought (2013, 2016) and ﬂoods (2008, 2012). Although, that NDVI was
found signiﬁcant different between zones f7 (0.45) and f15 (0.48), we could use a unique threshold value (0.4) for
monitoring drought and ﬂooding events in both zones. The differences found in zones f7 and f15 were reﬂected in
the insurance’s premium price, because each zone faces different drought and ﬂooding risk, and the ensured yield
is going to be different between these zones (f7=5.1 TM/ha and f15=6.7 TM/ha).
