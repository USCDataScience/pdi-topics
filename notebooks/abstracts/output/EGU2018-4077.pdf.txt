Swarm Electric Field Instruments: Science Accomplishments and
Prospects

David Knudsen and Johnathan Burchill
University of Calgary, Canada

Throughout Swarm’s ﬁrst four years in orbit, quality of data from the Swarm Electric Field Instruments has im-
proved steadily as techniques for compensating for unexpected anomalies have been reﬁned. Published scientiﬁc
applications of the EFI data range from studies of current systems associated with pulsating aurora, multiple au-
roral arcs and newly-discovered "STEVE"-type arcs; to studies of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling via Alfven
waves and Poynting ﬂux; to the existence of intense plasma ﬂows associated with quiet-time Birkeland current
systems; and others. Recently-released datasets with improved baselines and ﬂags are now available to expand the
scientiﬁc uses of these data to include studies of long-term trends in addition to additional as-yet undiscovered
phenomena.
