Measurement of riverbed material grainsizes is now a routine part of ﬁeldwork in ﬂuvial geomorphology and
lotic ecology. In the last decade, several authors have proposed remote sensing approaches of grain size measure-
ments based on terrestrial and aerial imagery. Given the current rise of small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS)
applications in geomorphology, there is now increasing interest in the application of these remotely sensed grain
size mapping methods to sUAS imagery. However, success in this area has been limited due to two fundamental
problems: lack of constraint of image scale for sUAS imagery and blurring effects in sUAS images and resulting
orthomosaics. We solve the former by showing that SfM-photogrammetry can be used in a direct georeferencing
(DG) workﬂow (i.e. with no ground validation) in order to predict image scale within margins of 3%. We then
propose a novel approach of robotic photosieving that relies on near-ground images processed with BASEGRAIN
gravelometry software and acquired from a low-cost sUAS and which does not require the presence of ground con-
trol points or visible scale objects. We demonstrate that this absence of scale objects does not affect photosieving
outputs thus resulting in a low-cost and efﬁcient sampling method for surﬁcial grains.
