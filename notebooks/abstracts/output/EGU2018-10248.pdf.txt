The environmental effects of volcanic ash: truths, misconceptions and
emerging questions

Ash emissions are the major product of volcanic explosive eruptions. Ash has long been associated with various
environmental effects. Most often, the extent of ash emission may be limited to a few dozen kilometres around
the volcano. However, the Earth’s history is punctuated by high-magnitude volcanic eruptions, and these may
have induced broader scale impacts on terrestrial and/or aquatic ecosystems. While several properties of ash are
evoked to describe how it interacts with a given environmental compartment; for example, surface chemistry,
soluble ﬂuoride content, iron solubility, grain size, colour, etc., there remains important uncertainties as well as
some misconceptions. Moreover, new questions about the inﬂuence that voluminous ash emissions and deposits
may have on the chemistry of the atmosphere, the biogeochemistry of the ocean, continental weathering ﬂuxes and
carbon sequestration in soils are also emerging. The objective of this talk is (i) to provide a critical discussion of
what we know and do not know about the environmental effects of ash, and their drivers, on different temporal and
spatial scales, and (ii) to suggest a few areas that would beneﬁt from fresh investigations.
