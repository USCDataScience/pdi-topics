Ozone pollution become a major topic in summer seasons in Shanghai, the largest megacity in Yangtze-River-Delta
Region. Series of measurements on ozone and its precursors were taken at ozone season in 2014-2017. The charac-
teristics of VOCs in city center, suburban area and industrial area were quite distinctive. Aromatics were the main
contributor to ozone pollution in city center area while alkenes were important in industrial area. Regional trans-
port of air mass brought large amount of ozone in some polluted cases. Ozone LIDAR was applied to investigate
the vertical proﬁle of ozone concentration in boundary layer and ozone transport. A detailed analysis on transport
route showed that ozone produced in surrounding cities could transport up to several hundred kilometers, leading
to a severe inﬂuence on night chemistry of Shanghai. The control policy of ozone in Shanghai was developed based
on the founding above.
