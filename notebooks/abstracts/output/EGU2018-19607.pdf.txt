Ocean Drilling in the ﬁelds of Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology

Marine sediments contain one of the world’s most complete archives of past climate and paleoceanographic
change. Here we will examine how geological records obtained through ocean drilling (i.e. Deep Sea Drilling
Project-DSDP: 1968–1983; Ocean Drilling Program-ODP: 1983–2003; Integrated Ocean Drilling Program-IODP:
2003–2013; International Ocean Discovery Program-IODP: 2013-2023) have contributed to the advance of our
understanding of paleoclimate, paleocenographic and sea level changes. We will identify some of the outstanding
questions and challenges that can best be addressed with ocean drilling. With current rising atmospheric greenhouse
gases resulting in rapidly increasing global temperatures forecasted in the most recent IPCC (Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2013, www. ipcc.ch/) report, studies of understanding global paleoclimate, pa-
leoceanographic and sea level changes are prominent on the research agenda.
