A great attention has been paid on the role of Arctic sea ice in the recent past. This is because the trend of the sea
ice concentration has been reducing. In addition, this might be associated with the frequent occurrence of severe
weather extreme via the modulation of atmospheric circulation. However, there is little study of how the sea ice
loss in the Arctic inﬂuences on the tropical Paciﬁc sea surface temperature as well as convection. Due to short
of observation, idealized experiments are required to examine its role as a forcing of sea ice in the Arctic on the
tropical Paciﬁc SST. Ensemble set of SST restoring experiment as well as the reanalysis dataset are analyzed. It is
found that Arctic sea ice loss in the Paciﬁc sector could lead to El Nino-like SST in the tropical Paciﬁc.
