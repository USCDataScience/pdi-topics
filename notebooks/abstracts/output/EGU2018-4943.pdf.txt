50 years of scientiﬁc ocean drilling have spanned the full range of scientiﬁc topics within the themes Earth Con-
nections and Earth in Motion. Subjects have included investigation of every element of the plate tectonic process
through to the dynamics and societally-relevant aspects of surface and shallow subsurface Earth processes. Scien-
tiﬁc ocean drilling, in many cases, offers the only opportunity to access in situ and complete geological records of
tectonic processes, or to measure and monitor the in situ properties of active Earth processes. Technological devel-
opments and advancements have, in parallel with our changing understanding of Earth system processes, increased
our ability to recover different rock and sediment types, to reach greater depths below seaﬂoor, to take accurate in
situ measurements of hydrological systems, slope failure planes and active fault planes, and to install observatories
100’s-1000’s m below the seaﬂoor. Recent projects have included study of the petrology and geochemistry of mid
ocean ridge processes and forearc/arc development, subduction initiation, multiple stages of the rifting process, the
range of subduction fault slip processes including large tsunami-generating earthquakes and slow slip, seaﬂoor ser-
pentinisation, major continental breakup and tectonic-paleoceanographic gateway development, and the dynamics
of impact cratering. This presentation will summarise some of the most signiﬁcant discoveries and future planned
projects, focussing on the recent phases of the scientiﬁc ocean drilling program (IODP).
