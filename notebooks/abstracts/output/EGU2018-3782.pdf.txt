Air quality in China has been improving steadily since 2013 after the implementation of the state control strategy.
The national PM2.5 annual concentrations dropped signiﬁcantly, from 45% to 25%, among heavily polluted
area of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province (BTH), indicating the major achievement of the government control
efforts. However, during the last ﬁve years, the meteorological conditions in various regions of China has also
been ﬂuctuated, which complicated the quantiﬁcation of control efforts. This paper presents a methodology and
an index EMI (environmental meteorology index) that is used to separate the meteorological and human control
factors. Analysis shows that the changing trends of air quality in China has a clear contribution of meteorological
factors. Detailed results of this research will be presented in the conference.
