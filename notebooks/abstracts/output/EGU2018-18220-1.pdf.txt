Abstract: PROTHEGO (PROTection of European Cultural HEritage from GeO-hazards) uses novel space
technology to monitor surface deformation with mm precision to analyze the impact of geohazards in cultural
heritage sites in Europe. The project includes the 395 monuments of UNESCO in Europe to monitor geo-hazards,
with case studies conducted in 4 UNESCO sites in England, Spain, Italy and Cyprus. The PROTHEGO project
uses long-term low-impact monitoring systems, such as UAVs and geodetic techniques, as well as InSAR data
to monitor and assess the risk from natural hazards on the archaeological site to evaluate potential geo-hazards.
This paper will present an overview of best practices for the innovative diagnosis, monitoring, mitigation and
preservation of Cultural Heritage monuments sites affected by geo-hazards that are potentially unstable due to
landslides, sinkholes, settlement, subsidence, active tectonics as well as structural deformation.
The "PROTection of European Cultural HEritage from GeO - hazards (PROTHEGO)” project HERITAGE
PLUS/0314/36 is funded in the framework of the Joint Programming Initiative on Cultural Heritage and Global
Change (JPICH) – HERITAGE PLUS under ERA-NET Plus and the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of
the European Commission and the Cyprus Research Promotion Foundation, contract KOINA/ΠΠ-HERITAGE
PLUS/0314/36.
