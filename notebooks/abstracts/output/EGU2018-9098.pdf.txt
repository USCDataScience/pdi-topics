More than Radon

Heinz Surbeck
(heinz.surbeck@sensemail.ch)

Lower limits for indoor radon have recently led to a radon business revival.
Unfortunately this has not led to more interest in the wealth of information
offered by natural radioactivity in general. This may be due to the fact that
the mental gap between geologists and environmental radioactivity specialist
has become far larger during the last 20 to 30 years. This contribution will
try to mitigate this a little bit. Examples from Switzerland will show that
both disciplines can proﬁt from a closer collaboration.
Of particular interest are disequilibria in the uranium decay series.
In this series there are different elements showing different geochemical
behaviour. In addition half lifes cover many orders of magnitude. Taking
into account both geochemical behaviour and half lifes helps to understand what’s
the reason for the many hot spots found in Swiss soils and groundwaters.
That goes from a strong radium anomaly in Jura Mountains’ soils, high radon
concentrations at hot springs to uranium accumulations in fossil and recent
wetlands.
