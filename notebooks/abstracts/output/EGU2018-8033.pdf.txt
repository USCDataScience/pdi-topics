Analysis of the urban materials thermal behavior is challenging because it requires the use of high spatial and
spectral resolution thermal data in order to detect impervious surfaces and urban vegetation, which can change
signiﬁcantly the local average surface temperature. Their distribution affects the urban surface heat island that is
one of the most important matters in urban climatology studies [1].
To study and analyze the urban thermal behavior and material properties (i.e. land surface temperature, emissivity)
in the study area, thermal infrared airborne remote hyperspectral data were used. The survey was carried out on
December 12, 2015, using TASI-600 sensor [3, 4, 5], on two urban districts pertaining to the Basilicata Region in
Italy. TASI-600 data were acquired with a spatial resolution of 1m/pixel and 32 channels from 8 to 11.5 µm with
a spectral resolution of 100 nm. The airborne surveys interested two urban and one industrial districts: the city of
Potenza (surveyed @ about 9:00 a.m. local time) with recently build urban functional areas and the city of Matera
(surveyed @ about 1:00 p.m. local time) with its ancient historical centre much appreciated and renowned for its
“Sassi” districts.
The advantage of the TASI airborne survey relies in the high spatial resolution that permits to clearly discriminate
objects and single roof buildings, while the high spectral resolution assures the detection of the major atmospheric
absorption bands required for an efﬁcient atmospheric correction. Temperature emissivity separation (TES) proce-
dure was efﬁciently applied to the TASI imagery to retrieve both temperature and spectral emissivity of the main
urban surfaces [2].
Temperature emissivity separation (TES) was carried out by solving the following equation,

Lλ,i = [ελ,iBλ(Ti) + (1 − ελ,i)LSKY λ]τλ + LAT M λ

where Lsky is the measured radiance, the downwelling radiance, Bλ(T i)the radiance from the surface, τλ is the
atmospheric transmittance, and LAT M λis the radiance associated with TIR self-emission of all atmospheric com-
ponents.
The obtained preliminary results are encouraging, as they show the beneﬁts of the use of airborne TIR hyperspectral
imaging for characterizing the main urban surfaces and understanding the urban temperature gradients which are
the main factor affecting the Urban Heat Island Effect.
This research was carried out in the framework of the project ‘Smart Basilicata’, Notice MIUR n.84/Ric 2012,
PON 2007-2013 of 2 March 2012 and was funded with the Cohesion Fund 2007–2013 of the Basilicata Regional
authority.
