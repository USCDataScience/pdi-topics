Mutual Information and Entropy based Band Selection for
Spectral-Spatial Classiﬁcation of Hyperspectral Images

Hyperspectral (HS) datasets are comprised of large numbers of spectral bands (∼100-300) with very narrow band-
width (∼5-10 nm), which are proven to be very efﬁcient for land-use land-cover classiﬁcation and numerous other
applications. However, the ﬁne spectral and spatial resolution of the HS dataset as compared to multi-spectral data
introduces the complexity of high dimensionality leading to high computational cost in data processing. In order to
address this issue besides achieving a signiﬁcantly improved classiﬁcation performance, a simple information the-
ory based band (or feature) selection approach is proposed in this study. Moreover a spectral-spatial classiﬁcation
technique is used to further enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy. The proposed approach utilizes an unsupervised
feature selection technique based on the information theory measures, mutual information and entropy. Spatial
information is included in the model by creating the morphological proﬁles corresponding to the spectral features
(bands) to improve the classiﬁcation performance. The classiﬁcation is carried out using the spectral-spatial fea-
tures in the support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer. This classiﬁcation approach has been evaluated for two HS
datasets i.e. Indian Pines and Botswana and the achieved overall accuracies are 94.05±0.66% and 97.01±0.77%
respectively. Further analysis also suggested that the proposed approach performs comparatively better than other
feature selection based classiﬁcation approaches available in literature.
