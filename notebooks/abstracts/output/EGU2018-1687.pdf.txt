A modeling study of the impact of irrigation on India’s climate

Humans have altered the earth’s surface - primarily by urbanization and agricultural activities (IPCC, 2013). Use
of land for agriculture, which is often accompanied by irrigation, modiﬁes the land surface through changes in
the water and energy balance between land surface and atmosphere. This further inﬂuences climatic parameters
like temperature, precipitation and cloud formation. The effect is more pronounced on local as compared to global
climate.
India is one of the regions of the world with a large irrigated area. The practice of irrigation has changed in recent
years resulting in depletion of groundwater. In future, as the groundwater sources get depleted, the effect on agri-
culture and climate are bound to be locally signiﬁcant. A systematic study on the effect of these changes is yet to
be carried out.
In this study, we use the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) with an active crop model coupled to the Commu-
nity Atmospheric Model (CAM5) to examine the impact of irrigation on the climate of India. We also carry out
experiments to evaluate the affect on local climate when irrigation water availability is curtailed.
