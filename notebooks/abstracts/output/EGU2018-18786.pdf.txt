Shear generated turbulence in the ocean

Shear-generated turbulence is an important source of mixing in the ocean ending the cascade of energy from
larger scales. Often because of sampling difﬁculties we are limited to deriving statistical relationships between
the turbulence activity and the larger scale properties of the ﬂuid ﬂow. The Western Equatorial Paciﬁc proves to
be an ideal natural laboratory to study shear-generated turbulence. Here turbulent production is dominated by the
shear associated with relatively long-lived ﬂow structures in the form of high vertical mode inertia-gravity waves
and ﬂow instabilities. With enough vertical resolution we can directly measure the characteristics of these ﬂow
features. We ﬁnd a strong relationship between the vertical shear and stratiﬁcation and the turbulent dissipation.
Using this relationship we can deduce the vertical mixing length scale and derive a parameterization scheme that
is shown to work well when applied to ﬂows with similar characteristics. An important lesson from this work is
the need to resolve adequately the ﬂow features generating the turbulence in both observations and models.
