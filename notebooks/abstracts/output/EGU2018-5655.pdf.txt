The JAXA Hayabusa 2 spacecraft is scheduled to arrive in April 2018 at 162173 Ryugu to start its year-long
mission near the asteroid. On-board is the Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (MASCOT), developed by the German
space agency (DLR) with major contributions by the French space agency (CNES) [1]. MASCOT will be ejected
towards the surface in October 2018 to land around noon local time. Ryugu is of the rare spectral type Cg, with
reﬂective properties of both the C and G-type asteroids [2]. The MASCOT mission at Ryugu is to study the surface
of this small, enigmatic asteroid up-close with its four instruments. Images acquired by the MASCOT camera
will contribute to this goal by characterizing the physical and reﬂective properties of the regolith at high spatial
resolution, providing the ground truth for the remote observations by the Hayabusa 2 instruments, and providing
context and guidance for the Hayabusa 2 sampling effort. The camera has a 54.5◦ ﬁeld-of-view and is equipped
with an LED array of 4 different colors to illuminate the surface at night [3]. The MASCOT mission is expected to
last about two asteroid days and nights, depending on the on-board battery performance. Several mission phases
can be distinguished: (1) descent, landing, and uprighting, (2) afternoon of day 1, (3) night 1, (4) day 2, (5), night
2, and (6) day 3. We describe the camera imaging plans for each of these phases in detail.
