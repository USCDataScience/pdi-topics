In contrast to the stable C, N and O isotope composition of plant materials, the hydrogen isotope composition of
plant organic compounds has not yet been established as a tool in ecological or biogeochemical research. With
the development of new analytical instruments that allow the hydrogen isotope analysis of selected plant com-
pounds there is, however, growing interest to explore the power of hydrogen isotopes as tools for ecological and
biogeochemical research. In my talk I will summarize recent work from my lab where we show that the hydrogen
isotope composition of lipids and carbohydrates reﬂect the carbon and energy metabolism in plants: Our exper-
iments revealed that that autotrophic and carbon-autonomous plant tissue is 2H depleted while heterotrophic or
non-carbon-autonomous tissue is 2H enriched. We were able to identify various biochemical processes during the
biosynthesis of plant tissue that contribute to these patterns and can show that these patterns apply for various levels
of organization: across plant species (e.g. heterotrophic parasitic plants and their autotrophic hosts), across differ-
ent organs within an individual plant (e.g. autotrophic leaves vs. heterotrophic roots), and even within a plant organ
(e.g. following the transition of a leaf from a carbohydrate sink to a carbohydrate source during ontogeny). As such,
the hydrogen isotope composition of plant tissue seems to be a robust proxy for the carbohydrate metabolism in
plants and could serve thus as an important new tool in plant ecology, plant breeding, biogeochemistry, and paleo
applications.
