With 80 radionuclide detection systems worldwide, the International monitoring system (IMS) offers an unprece-
dented opportunity to use 7Be as an aerosol tracer for global meteorological processes.
7Be is a cosmogenic radionuclide and a vertical downward inﬂux tracer that can be used as a new parameter for
seasonal weather forecast and climate change.
With a 53-day half-life and due to its physical properties 7Be is suitable to study large scale circulations such as
Hadley and Ferrel cell dynamics.
The close relationship between Hadley-Ferrel cell convergence zone and Monsoons make 7Be a reliable indicator
for Monsoon onset and withdrawal forecast.
Cross correlations of 7Be activity concentrations at different monitoring stations has the potential to serve as
an early warning index for monsoon regions worldwide with over 30-day warning prior to monsoon onset and
withdrawal.
7Be timeseries indicate the trend of atmospheric cell shift. Therefore, 7Be is a more reliable index than water
content, as it is linked to the cause rather than the side effects of monsoon phenomena.
This study focuses on monsoon forecast accuracy versus early warning time and how much deviation improves
from a multi-year ﬁt.
Near-surface 7Be activity concentrations may help address outstanding challenges in monsoon research by
integrating a new perspective across the disciplines of environmental radiation monitoring and meteorology.
