Climate impact assessments typically rely on Earth system simulations of the 21st century that do not include
volcanic eruptions. In a new study (http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nclimate3394), we show that climate
variance inﬂates if plausible volcanic forcing is applied to such simulations. Increased climate variance exerts
additional stresses on ecosystem and society. Incorporating potential volcanism in climate impact assessments can
thus be important for certain adaptation and mitigation decisions. This talk aims to address: How can we use
knowledge of past volcanism to inform impact assessments in the wake of CMIP6? Where can we expect the
consideration of volcanism to make a difference?
