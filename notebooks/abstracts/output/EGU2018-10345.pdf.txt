The newly renamed, Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission will be the ﬁrst mission to ﬂy into the low solar corona,
revealing how the corona is heated and the solar wind and energetic particles are accelerated, solving fundamental
mysteries that have been top priority science goals since such a mission was ﬁrst proposed in 1958. The scale
and concept of such a mission has been revised at intervals since that time, yet the core has always been a close
encounter with the Sun. The primary science goal of the Parker Solar Probe mission is to determine the structure
and dynamics of the Sun’s coronal magnetic ﬁeld, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and
accelerated, and determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles. PSP uses an innovative
mission design, signiﬁcant technology development and a risk-reducing engineering development to meet the
science objectives. In this presentation, we provide an overview of the mission science and design, and an update
on the progress of the Parker Solar Probe mission as we prepare for the July 2018 launch.
