The European Copernicus Space component comprises several satellite missions to measure atmospheric trace
gases like carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide from the shortwave infrared spectral range. Recently, on
October 13th 2017, ESA’s Sentinel 5 Precursor mission was successfully launched with the TROPOMI instrument
as its single payload. In the near future, it will be followed up by the Sentinel 5 mission scheduled for launch
2021 and the Sentinel 7 candidate mission for anthropogenic CO2 monitoring. These missions will provide the
operational backbone of European’s Earth observatory of climate relevant trace gases. In this presentation, we
will present ﬁrst results of the TROPOMI methane and carbon monoxide data product and discuss the preliminary
achievements also in the perspective of the future Copernicus missions.
