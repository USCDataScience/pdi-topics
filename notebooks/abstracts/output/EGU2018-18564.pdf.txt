Quiescent volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) -much alike anthropogenic point-source emissions- vary
spatially at the 0.1-10 kilometer-scale and are useful to track to detect phases of unrest, including pre-eruptive
emission pulses which may indicate magma movement, or to document source strengths. CO2 emissions create
short-range broad plumes which may diverge in their dispersion behavior from sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the
same source, due to the largely unreactive diffusion-dominated behavior of CO2 in the atmosphere. Plumes may
be discernible from space within their spatial context but the characteristics of aging plumes may pose additional
challenges to quantiﬁcation and attribution.
We will compare the different space-borne assets potentially useful to volcanic CO2 detections and monitoring ap-
plications, and discuss results recently published (Schwandner et al. 2017, Science) that showed the ﬁrst volcanic
CO2 detections from space-borne sensors: Space-borne measurements by NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-
2 (OCO-2) have exposed distinct structures of atmospheric CO2 on kilometer scales over known anthropogenic
and volcanic point sources. However, the 16-day repeat cycle of OCO-2 was not optimized to meaningfully track
the temporal evolution of these emissions. The Japanese Greenhouse Gas Observing SATellite (GOSAT) has little
option for spatial context, but a faster 3 days repeat cycle. Future observations by the OCO-3 instrument, to be
launched and installed on the International Space Station, will have pointing optics and will provide better op-
portunities to track CO2 emissions from individual volcanoes at meaningful spatial and temporal modes. NASA’s
scheduled GeoCARB mission will in the longer term provide additional opportunities to quantify CO2 emissions
from geostationary orbit.
