In thunderstorm environment aircraft experience different types of radiation during a lightning ﬂash. With
sophisticated lightning detection equipment (ILDAS) on board Airbus test aircraft we have identiﬁed four distinct
types of high-energy emissions that can penetrate through the aircraft fuselage. They are as follows:

1. Nanosecond long x-ray pulses during initiation of negative stepped aircraft-triggered leaders.
2. Microsecond long x-ray bursts from the recoil processes during lightning ﬂashes.
3. Second long positron annihilation signatures from static discharges.
4. Minute long gamma-ray glows from thunderclouds.

In this presentation we will discuss these phenomena and give examples of their appearances. They will be
compared to ground and laboratory measurements.
