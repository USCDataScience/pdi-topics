We analyze the well observed ﬂare-CME event from October 1, 2011 and cover the complete chain of action –
from the Sun to Earth. We study in detail the solar surface and atmosphere (SDO and ground-based instruments)
associated to the ﬂare/CME and also track the off-limb CME signatures in interplanetary space (STEREO-SoHO).
This is complemented by surface magnetic ﬁeld information and 3D coronal magnetic ﬁeld modeling. From in-situ
measurements (Wind), we extract the corresponding ICME characteristics. Results show that the ﬂare reconnection
ﬂux is most probably a lower limit for estimating the magnetic ﬂux within the ﬂux rope as 1) magnetic reconnection
processes were already ongoing before the start of the impulsive ﬂare phase and 2) the dimming ﬂux increased by
more than 25% after the end of the ﬂare, indicating that magnetic ﬂux was still added to the ﬂux rope after eruption.
When comparing this to the in-situ axial magnetic ﬂux of the magnetic cloud, we ﬁnd that it is reduced by at least
75%, referring to substantial erosion in interplanetary space. Careful inspection of on-disk features associated with
CMEs are essential for interpreting such scenarios.
