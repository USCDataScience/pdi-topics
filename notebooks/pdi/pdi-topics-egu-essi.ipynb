    "\n",
    "This notebook does topic modeling on ESSI EGU abstracts from 2018, the objective is to see if the current sessions match the topics discovered on the abstracs themselves so the organizers can adjust the sessions to asign abstracts in a better way. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to notice is that topic modeling algorithms work better with a bigger more diverse corpus, the abstracts submitted to a particular categor will have a lot of overlap and picking up topics is more of a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right questions may be, **if we were to reduce the number of individual sessions what that would look like?**\n",
    "Likewise, if we want to be more specific on the sessions' topics we could asjust the LDA algorithm to a higher cluster number and see the resulting topics. Now let's get to the code.\n",
